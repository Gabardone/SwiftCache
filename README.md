# SwiftCache

An asynchronous, modular cache or data pipeline system (really you can build either with this).

This API is still in prototype stage, although it seems to have settled down in the last few revisions. After a bit more
use it will get fully documented and released to the public, probably as version 2.x.x.

While it is a bit raw in terms of documentation and test coverage it shouldn't be too hard to understand. If anyone
wants to check it out and offer feedback I would appreciate.

Potential development directions:
- Add cancelation facilities.
- Add async sequence APIs (i.e. progressively better results).
- Add throttling logic to network data sources.
