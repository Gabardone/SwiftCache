# SwiftCache

An asynchronous, modular cache system or data pipeline system (really you can build either with this).

This API is in prototype stage and thus I do not recommend anyone to touch it. Once I've used it in a couple more
personal projects and am sure it's solid I'll make sure the test coverage is up to par and release a version 1.0.0.

Potential development directions:
- Add cancelation facilities.
- Add async sequence APIs (i.e. progressively better results).
- Add throttling logic to network data sources.
