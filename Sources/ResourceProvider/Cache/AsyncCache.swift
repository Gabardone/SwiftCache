/**
 Protocol for asynchronous caches to adopt.

 The visible API of a asynchronous cache is basically as an asynchronous dictionary. Besides access being asynchronous,
 the main difference is that storing a value does not guarantee that it will be there when requested later as the cache
 is free to remove the value from storage in-between.

     Returns the value for the given `id`, if present.

     The method will return `nil` if the value is not being stored by the cache, whether because it was never stored or
     because it was invalidated at some point.
     - Parameter id: The id whose potentially cached value we want.

     A cache offers no guarantees whatsoever that the value stored _will_ be returned later but _if_ it is returned
     later it will be exactly the same value passed in this method.

     If a cache is used independently of providers it may be useful to store as `AnyAsyncCache`, so any built cache will
     need to be type-erased before being stored.

     This method has a default implementation that will only rarely need to be overwritten.
