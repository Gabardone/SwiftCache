/**
 A resouce provider that returns values synchronously.

 A `SyncProvider` doesn't allow for failure in value retrieval, so it's best used for cases where the values are
 generated. Examples of use would be:
 - To manage quick to generate large object (i.e. images) where we want to keep around only the ones we're using, with
 a `WeakObjectCache`.
 - To abstract away old synchronous APIs like AppKit document facilities where we are also limited in being able to make
 things asynchronous.
