/**
 A resouce provider that returns values asynchronously and may fail.

 A `ThrowingAsyncProvider` will `throw` if value retrieval fails. It vends the most complete API and as such is used for
 the more complex resource providers such as:
 - Resource download from the network.
 - Complex database retrieval.
